# Code your game narration

Don't worry! Yes, if you are here, you want to learn with the most easy words, how to code your novel...

It's easy! the first thing that you need to know it's all KaNovel games starts with `kanovel()`

```javascript
kanovel()
```
## Character

Now, one of the parts of a kanovel game it's `characters`, how we can create a character? No worries, it's easy too!
We will use `character()`, and inside of the `()` we will add a ID, and a Displayable name, separated by comma (this is the way to separate the `arguments`)

```javascript
kanovel()

character("d", "Danie")
```
