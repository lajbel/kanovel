# A novel, Â¿What's it?

Visual novels are like novels, but with visuals (as well as sound), so let's highlight two parts of a visual novel (speaking about games)

-   Characters: Normally the protagonists of a novel, here would be primary characters, secondary characters, narrator and everything that has a voice

-   Actions: Visual novel actions, such as showing or hiding a character, having a character speak, or changing the background

On the basis of these two concepts, we can build everything else
